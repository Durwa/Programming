- C language:
> C is a general-purpose programming language that is extremely popular, simple and flexible. It is machine-independent, structured programming language which is used extensively in various applications.
C was the basic language to write everything from operating systems (Windows and many others) to complex programs like the Oracle database, Git, Python interpreter and more.
It is said that 'C' is a god's programming language. One can say, C is a base for the programming. If you know 'C,' you can easily grasp the knowledge of the other programming languages that uses the concept of 'C'
It is essential to have a background in computer memory mechanisms because it is an important aspect when dealing with the C programming language.

- What is the use of C language?
> C language is used to develop system applications that forms major portion of operating systems such as Windows, UNIX and Linux. Operating systems, C compiler and all UNIX application programs are written in C language. Below are some examples of uses of C language.

# Introduction:

## Constants,Variables and Keywords:
- constants:Constants refer to fixed values that the program may not alter during its execution. These fixed values are also called literals.
Constants can be of any of the basic data types like an integer constant, a floating constant, a character constant, or a string literal. There are enumeration constants as well.
Constants are treated just like regular variables except that their values cannot be modified after their definition.
- Variables:A variable is nothing but a name given to a storage area that our programs can manipulate. Each variable in C has a specific type, which determines the size and 
layout of the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.
- Keywords:Keywords are the words whose meaning has already been explained to the C compiler and their meanings cannot be changed. Keywords serve as basic building blocks for 
program statements. Keywords can be used only for their intended purpose. Keywords cannot be used as user-defined variables.
